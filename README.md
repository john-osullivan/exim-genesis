Quorum-Genesis
==============

Very simple utility for [Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) to help
populate the genesis file with voters and blockmakers. Runs from the commandline

Setup
-----
 * Install Node.js
 * Install this package globally `npm install -g`


Use
---

 1. Create a `quorum-config.json` file
 2. Run `quorum-genesis` from a terminal in the same directory as the config file
 3. It will output `quorum-genesis.json`


The `quorum-config.json` should be in the following format:

```json
{
  "threshold": 3,
  "voters": [
    "0x0fbdc686b912d7722dc86510934589e0aaf3b55a",
    "0x9186eb3d20cbd1f5f992a950d808c4495153abd5",
    "0x0638e1574728b6d862dd5d3a3e0942c3be47d996"
  ],
  "makers": ["0xca843569e3427144cead5e4d5999a3d0ccf92b8e"],
  "owners": ["0x5d1370047cf530d6533ce18472d871c6714c2505"]
}
```

Where:

* `threshold` is the number of required voters
* `voters` is a list of voter addresses
* `makers` is a list of blockmaker addresses
